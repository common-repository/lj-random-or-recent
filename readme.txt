== Description ==

LJ Random or Recent is a Wordpress plugin/widget that allows you to display a list of Random or Recent posts depending of the type of pages that is being displayed. This plugin can also assist your site for SEO by digging up and making your older content relevant.

The idea was taken from the iNove theme which by default has a similar setup in the sidebar, I just wanted a little bit more functionality plus the ability to put the widget anywhere on the page with any theme.

1. Unzip and upload the `LJRandomOrRecent` folder into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the Plugin through the Plugins menu
3. Add widget to your sidebar
